UTMDigital Open Day provided valuable exposure and meaningful benefits to students. The programme broadened my understanding of the technology field and helped me gain a clearer perspective on potential career directions. Through visits to the data centre and participation in various talks, I was able to observe how technology is organised, managed, and applied in real working environments, including the use of agile practices and the scrum framework.

In addition, I was given the opportunity to interview a UTMDigital staff member, which allowed me to experience basic interview skills in a professional setting. This interaction increased my interest and motivation towards future involvement in the technology industry.

Previously, my understanding of information technology was mainly based on theoretical knowledge. However, this visit allowed me to see how systems are implemented in real-life operations. UTMDigital has developed and maintains several important platforms such as the MyUTM Portal, e-Learning system, campus Wi-Fi services, and other management systems that support daily activities of students and staff.
