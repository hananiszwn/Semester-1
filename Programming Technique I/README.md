### COURSE SYNOPSIS
-  As a fundamental subject, this course equips the students with theory and practice on problem solving techniques by using the structured approach.
-  The course covers the following: preprocessor directives, constants and variables, data types, input and output statements, control structures: sequential, selection and loop, built-in and user-defined functions, single and two dimensional arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data 
types.
-  Students are required to develop programs using C++ programming language, in 
order to solve simple to moderate problems.
-  A learning approach that combines lectures, lab exercises, and assignments strengthens both conceptual understanding and practical 
programming skills.
-  Students will be able to apply systematic problem-solving methods to analyze and address programming challenges.
-   Develop structured approach C++ programs to solve problems of varying complexity within a specified time frame.
