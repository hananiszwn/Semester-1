### COURSE SYNOPSYS

- This foundational course introduces students to the principles of digital electronics as the basis for 
microprocessor-based systems in computers, robots, automobiles, and industrial control applications.
- It covers key topics including number systems and codes, logic gates, Boolean algebra, combinational logic circuits, 
latches, flip-flops, counters, and shift registers, progressing from basic concepts to programmable logic devices. 
- Teaching and learning are carried out through lectures, tutorials, hands-on labs with Deeds Software, and 
project-based activities, emphasizing problem-solving, collaboration, and practical application.
- By the end of the course, students will be able to apply digital logic fundamentals, design and construct circuits using 
simulation tools and real devices, and suggest improvements to enhance solutions for practical problems.
